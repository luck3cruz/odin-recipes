        <h1> Filipino Chicken Adobo Recipe</h1>
            Perhaps the most famous dish in the Filipino repertoire, chicken adobo has as many versions as there are cooks in the Philippines. Some recipes omit garlic, others add coconut milk, some feature brothy sauce, and others reduce that liquid to an intense glaze. Try this healthy recipe first (with plenty of white rice), then the next time around, go wild.

        <h2> Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> 2 tablespoons canola oil </li>
            <li> 5 chicken drumsticks <em>(about 1 3/4 pounds)</em> </li>
            <li> bone-in chicken thighs <em>  (about 1 3/4 pounds) </em></li>
            <li> 1 large yellow onion, quartered and sliced 1/4 inch thick</li>
            <li> 8 cloves garlic, smashed</li>
            <li> 5 bay leaves </li>
            <li> ¼ teaspoon whole black peppercorns</li>
            <li> 1 cup cane vinegar or unseasoned rice vinegar</li>
            <li> ⅓ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
        </ul> <br>

        <h2> Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat until it starts to shimmer. Add drumsticks and cook until brown on all sides, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Add thighs to the pot and cook until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to the plate with the drumsticks. </li> <br>
            <li> Add onion, garlic, bay leaves and peppercorns to the pot; cook, stirring occasionally, until the garlic just begins to brown, about 3 minutes. Add vinegar and soy sauce and bring to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits. Return the chicken to the pot and turn to coat with the sauce. Reduce heat to maintain a gentle simmer, cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is very tender, about 1 hour.</li> <br>
            <li> Transfer the chicken to a clean plate and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Bring the sauce to a boil and cook, stirring often, until reduced by about one-third, 3 to 5 minutes. Serve the chicken with the sauce.</li> <br>
        </ol>
